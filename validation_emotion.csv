"Sometimes i pretend that i dont care. But really, i care more than anyone else ever will."
Happiness is a realm of true courage.
I love you more than there are stars in the sky and fish in the sea.
"Fire is like love, it keeps you warm but sometimes you'll get burned."
My Real Smile Comes when i am with you.
"Your mistake is letting me go, my mistake was letting you in."
"Do not aim to be better than the other person, but aim to better yourself."
It took seeing what my life is like without you to know that i want you in it. i’m sorry for ever hurting you.

People are selfish now a days.
COUNT blessings NOT problems.
Its hurts the worst when the person that made you feel so special yesterday makes you feel so unwanted today.
"When you give lots of importance to someone, you loss your own importance in their life…."
"I love you yesterday I love you still, I always have... I always will"
Nothing hurts more than realizing he was everything to you and you were nothing.
One that is happy will devour enjoyment of the scenery on a detour route.
Silence is the best way to react while angry.

My weakness is that I care too much.
My silence doesn’t mean that I quit… It simply means that I don’t want to argue with people who just don’t want to understand!
"Happiness is a direction, not a place. The only thing that will make you happy is being happy with who you are"
Don't play with my heart if you have no intentions for a serious relationship.
"Don’t expect me to tell you what you did wrong. If you can’t figure it out yourself, then you are not ready to correct it,cos you did not know it was a mistake."
"Anger makes dull men witty, but it keeps them poor."

Don’T Make So Many Promises When You Can’T Even Keep One.
Some Things Can Never Be Forgotten And Nor Forgiven.
Sitting alone and enjoying your own company is better than being surrounded by fake people.
Be like a flower that gives its fragrance to even the hand that crushes it.
Turn Around And Realize They Have The Knife 6 Inches Deep In Your Back.
I’m sorry I was not good enough. But i tried to be.
You think that you have damaged me but really you just made me that much more stronger.. Thank You!!
The embarrassment after the anger is biggest humiliation a person can experience.
Sometimes your voice is the medicine to all my diseases.
"Anger is our natural deffense against pain. So when i say i hate you, it really means you hurt me."
"When you love what you have, you have everything you need"
The new way of forgetting your past is deleting your chats 😛
"To know the person, you must love him"
It sucks when you realize you rejected other people for that one person who wasted your time.
"True love doesn't have a happy ending,because True love never ends...."
"When you ask someone if you over reacted, then that’s your heart telling your mind that it was a stupid decision."
I Don’T Need To Explain Myself Because I Know I’M Right.
Bungee jumping is suicide with strings attached!

Anger is a feeling that makes your mouth work than faster your mind..
"204 countries, 805 Islands, 7 seas, 7+ Billion people and I’m single!!!"
Anger always comes from frustrated expectations.
Love can't be found Where it doesn't exist ..
"I think i love you, but don't even know you."
"I don’t usually lose my temper, but if I get angry, it’s true I’m scary."
Sometimes i'm not angry i'm hurt and there's a big difference.
My phone screen is brighter than my future ?
A smile is a curve that sets everything straight.
The word EXAMS make me sick without PAIN.
A heart filled with joy has more worth than a pocket of coins.
one day you`ll realize...all the love that i gave to you...is now being given to someone else 
Happy thoughts are seeds that sow positivity in abundance.
Telling someone to calm down just makes them so much more angry.
No texts.No calls.nothing.but i'm still here thinking about you like crazy. 
"Never forget what someone says to you when they are angry, because that’s when the truth comes out."
It sucks when you realise you rejected other people for that one person who wasted your time.

Never regret something that once made you smile.
I text you because I want to have a conversation with you. Not to get one word answers.
"I’m born to express, not to impress."
My attitude depends on the people in front of me.
You should have two facebook accounts. One for each face.
Smile! It is the second best thing you can do with your lips.
"“You told me I was perfect, but you still left. I should have known my perfect wouldn’t be good enough.”"
"I want vitamin ""U"""
Every time You smile I smile.
I hate seeing you because you bring back the feelings I tried so hard to forget.
"It\’s Not Just The Goodbyes That Hurts, It\’s The Flashbacks That Follows…"
"No Matter How Hard I Try, No Matter How Many Relationships I Get Into…. It Will Never Replace The One I Just Lost."
I will not delete you or block you. I’m keeping you there so you will be able to see how happy I’m without you…
I will not delete you or block you. I’m keeping you there so you will be able to see how happy I’m without you.
Follow Your Heart But Don;T Be Stupid.
My silence doesn’t mean that I quit… It simply means that I don’t want to argue with people who just don’t want to understand.
Taking your ex back is like going to the junk yard and buying back your own crap.
Happiness means you. I Love You.
"Don’t put words into my mouth. I have got plenty to say. Don’t tell me how to live my life, I do things my way."
Aspire to Inspire before you expire
"If you think a simple task is powerful, just keep going"

is wishing that SOME people would understand that: IT’S NOT ALL ABOUT YOU!!
A good laugh and a long sleep are the best cures for anything.
When life gives you a hundred reasons to cry show life you have a thousand reasons to smile
Don't be much closer to anybody because a small change in their behavior hurts a lot.

Time doesn't really heal a heart it just makes the heart forget about the pain...
"I don't need a perfect relationship, I just need someone who won't give up on me."
Sometimes it's better to be alone. Nobody can hurt you!
"There are Billions of people in this world, but sometimes you really need just one."
"I’m on a sea-food diet, I see food, I eat it!"
"Achievement, as a rule, goes to the individuals who are excessively occupied for it"
I actually don’t need to control my anger. Everyone around me needs to control their habit of pissing me off…
The only difference between a good day and a bad day is your attitude.
Train your mind to see good in everything.
"I don’t get tired of loving you. I just get tired of waiting, assuming, hearing lies, saying sorry and getting hurt."
Never make yourself feel like nothing to make someone else feel like everything.

"You can close your eyes to the things you don’t want to see, but you can’t close your heart to the things you don’t want to feel."

"Stop asking for faithful girls, when you are too busy chasing hoes."
"I don’t give up easily on someone, but when I finally do I will be so done with you and nothing you’ll ever do will bring me back."
You only get hurt if you actually give a fuck.
Happiness is living each day as if it is your first honeymoon day and last vacation day.
